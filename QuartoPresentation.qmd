### ***Jesse Marsch's S.A.R.D. acronym to articulate his tactical approach***

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
::: r-fit-text
-   Sprinting(S):

    -   Importance of strategic sprinting, particularly in pressing situations.

    -   Marsch encourages players to make twice as many out-of-possession sprints, focusing on timing and positioning.

-   Alle Gemeinsam (A):

    -   Stands for 'all together.'

    -   Advocates for a ball-oriented pressing system where all players attack the ball collectively.

-   Reingehen (R):

    -   Translates to 'going in.'

    -   Involves a commitment to fully attack the ball, discouraging players from stopping short of the opponent.

-   Dazukommen (D):

    -   Represents the second wave of the press.

    -   Importance of each press wave being supported by additional players.

::: {.column width="25%"}
::: r-fit-text
![Marsch's pressing philosophy encourages players to initiate the press when the ball is in transit, rather than waiting for it to be received by the opponent. The team commits multiple players to the ball during the press, with an awareness of the need to quickly revert to a defensive shape if the opposition manages to switch play. This comprehensive approach aims to optimize the success of the pressing strategy and create goal-scoring opportunities.](photos/Marsch.png)

### ***NYRB 2018 Supporters Shield Winners:***

#### ***The Epitome of the Red Bull Style***

::: r-fit-text
-   Frenzied, organized high press.

-   Offensive Dynamics Mirroring Defensive Intensity

    -   BWP leading the line: Key role in shrinking the field and initiating the press.

    -   Playmakers and Midfield Disrupters: Kaku, wingers, Tyler Adams and Sean Davis intensify the high-pressure strategy.

-   Direct and Intense Attack

    -   Keep the ball in the opposition's half.

    -   Attacking Patterns: Center backs play long to BWP, fullbacks deliver driven passes into front 4, and the midfield pivot propels direct attacks.

-   Most importantly: Style translated to winning success

### ***Process of Calculating Percentiles***

::: r-fit-text
-   **The What:**

    -   Percentiles indicate where each club's average normalized values for each stat stand compared to the overall distribution of teams.

-   **The Why:**

    -   With the Red Bulls distinct, energetic and some might say unbalanced style of play they tend to be in the tail ends of the distributions of various metrics.
    -   Percentiles were calculated to see what stats the NYRB were accumulating the most over the past 6 seasons compared to the rest of the MLS.
    -   This helps do 2 things:
        -   Investigate some of these variables further to see how "extreme" the play style is.

        -   Use these percentiles as weights in a metric defining "Red Bull Style of Play" to value what is "important" to the style.

-   **The How:**

    -   First, find the mean for each variable for each club in each year.

        -   $\mu_i = \text{mean}(\text{x}_i \mid (\text{club} \cap \text{year}))$

    -   Next, create a normalized value based on said mean for each variable.

        -   $N_i = (\mu_i - min(\mu) / (max(\mu) - min(\mu))$

    -   Then, for each club take the mean of the normalized values.

        -   $M_i = mean(N_i | club)$

    -   Finally, calculate the percentile for the mean of the averaged normalized values.

        -   $P_i = M_i / max(M)$

![](photos/RBNYlogo.png){fig-align="center" width="100"}
:::

```{r}
percentiles <- full_match_logs %>%
  group_by(Club, Year) %>% 
  # Mean for each club in each year
  summarise(across(c(11:ncol(.)-2), ~mean(.))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Normalized value based on mean for each club in each year
  summarise(Club, across(c(3:ncol(.), -Club), ~(. - min(.)) / (max(.) - min(.)))) %>%
  group_by(Club) %>%
  # Mean for said normalized value
  summarise(across(c(2:ncol(.)-1), ~mean(.))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Percentile for mean of normalized value
  summarise(Club, across(c(2:ncol(.), -Club), ~./max(.))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(2:ncol(.)), names_to = "stat", values_to = "percentile") 

rbny_percentiles <- percentiles %>% filter(Club == "NY Red Bulls") %>% arrange(desc(percentile))

### ***Process of Calculating Style of Play Metric***

::: r-fit-text
-   **The What:**

    -   A metric that can be applied for each team to each game to quantify a value that represents the "Red Bull Style of Play".
    -   Values between 0 and 1 where as the value increases towards 1 the teams style of play for the game more closely mirrors the "Red Bull Style of Play".

-   **The Why:**

    -   The metric is designed to align with the Red Bull distinct style, capturing the essence of their dynamic and appealing approach to the game while showing how different they are to other teams.
    -   Recognizes that certain statistical attributes, when exhibited by the team, contribute more significantly to embodying the distinctive and impactful style.
    -   Enables a nuanced understanding of how closely a team's style of play mirrors the energetic and unbalanced characteristics of play.

-   **The How:**

    -   First, create a normalized value for each statistic for each match.

        -   $N_i = (x - min(x) / (max(x) - min(x))$

    -   Then, multiply normalized values by the NYRB percentile for given stat.

        -   $S_i = (N_i * P_{ij} )| j = NYRB)$

    -   Calculate the mean of the multiplied values for each match.

        -   ${\mu}_k = mean(S_k)$

    -   Normalize the means to create the metric for "Red Bull Style of Play" with values between 0 & 1.

        -   ${RBSOP}_k = (\mu_k - min(\mu)) / (max(\mu) - min(\mu))$

```{r}

normalized <- full_match_logs %>%
  select(Year, everything()) %>%
  # Normalized value for each match
  summarise(
    Club, Year, Time, Round, Day, Venue, Result, GF, GA, Opponent,

  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(11:ncol(.)), names_to = "stat", values_to = "normalized")

### ***Process of Calculating Win Probability***

::: r-fit-text
-   **The What:**

    -   A metric that can be applied to each game signifying "how well they played" or how likely they were to win based on all statistics excluding statistics about goals.
    -   Values between -1 and 1 where:
        -   -1 = Loss
        -   0 = Draw
        -   1 = Win

-   **The Why:**

    -   Something to compare Red Bull Style of Play metric to.
    -   See if there appears to be some sort of relationship with the Red Bull Style of Play and winning soccer.

-   **The How:**

    -   Fit a Random Forest model of games from 6 seasons regressing the Result of match based on statistics excluding goals for each team.

```{r}
#library(randomForest)

set.seed(123)

modeling_df <- full_match_logs %>% select(Result, Venue, c(12:ncol(.)-1), -Opponent_Gls) %>%
  mutate(Result = case_when(
    Result == "W" ~ 1,
    Result == "D" ~ 0,
    Result == "L" ~ -1
  )) %>%
  # Rename columns with a '/' in it to 'per'
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "/", "per"), contains("/")) %>%
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "-", "minus"), contains("-")) %>%
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "\\+", "plus"), contains("+")) %>%
  rename(Final_3rd_Passes = `1per3`,
         Second_yellow = `2CrdY`) %>%
  select(-c(GperSh, GperSoT, GminusxG, npGminusxG, Ast, GCA:GCA_Def, 
            Opponent_GperSh, Opponent_GperSoT, Opponent_GminusxG, Opponent_npGminusxG, Opponent_Ast, Opponent_GCA:Opponent_GCA_Def))

#rf_model <- randomForest(Result ~ ., data = modeling_df, importance = TRUE, ntree = 50)

#predicted_probabilities <- predict(rf_model, modeling_df, type = "response")

#match_probabilities <- full_match_logs %>% mutate(predicted_probability = predicted_probabilities) %>%
 # select(Club, Year, Time, Round, Day, Venue, Result, GF, GA, Opponent, predicted_probability)

#write.csv(match_probabilities, "match_probabilities.csv")

### ***Evaluating NYRB Percentiles***

::: {.r-fit-text height="50%"}
-   NYRB ranks in the top percentile for 28 variables (\~11% of the time).

-   Many variables with a high percentile directly relate to the distinct "Red Bull Style of Play" as described earlier.

    -   Some of these variables showcase the strengths of the style as well as the weaknesses.

-   Variables that have a relatively low percentile shows some of the inverse effects of the chaotic nature of the style.

**New York Red Bull Percentiles:**

```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(rbny_percentiles %>% filter(stat != "Week") %>%
              mutate(percentile = round(percentile, 2) * 100),
          options = list(
            paging = TRUE,
            searching = TRUE,
            pageLength = 10
          )) %>%
  formatStyle(names(rbny_percentiles), background = '#FFCCCB', color = 'black') 
```

See Glossary on Match Log pages on [Fbref.com](Fbref.com) to get descriptions of most variables. (Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions as I also feature engineered a few variables).

### ***Evaluating "Red Bull Statistics"***

::: {.r-fit-text height="50%"}
-   Below is just a few of potentially many graphs that can be used to visualize the distinct style of play that NYRB possesses chosen from the percentiles on the previous slide.

-   The graphs show the per 90 minutes stats in each year with NYRB colored in red.

-   These graphs illustrate the Red Bulls' consistent playing style over the past six seasons.

-   NYRB points consistently appear away from the normal distribution, setting them apart from the rest of the league in crucial statistical categories that hold particular significance for their team.

-   **Task:**

    -   Using provided StatsBomb event data from the 2016 game to tell the "Story of the Game."

-   **Overview of the Game:**

    -   Not one, but two Dax McCarty headers.
    -   A Bradley Wright-Phillips bicycle kick.
    -   It was the perfect storm for the Red Bulls, who concluded their fourth game against NYCFC with seven goals on the scoresheet.
    -   The final scoreline of 7-0 remains tied for the largest margin of victory in MLS history.

#### ***The Story of The Game***

::: r-fit-text
-   Red Bulls Dominated.
-   Even though NYCFC held onto the ball for longer periods of time it was NYRB who dominated the field positioning as the majority of the game was played in their attacking 3rd.
-   The high field positioning resulted in consistent plays of positive Net On Ball Value showcasing how NYRB was purposeful with doing the right things and playing forward.
-   NYRB was structurally position high up the field in both defense and attack.
-   The Red Bull Press Never Stops.

In this presentation, we delved into the distinctive philosophy and style of play embraced by the New York Red Bulls, commonly known as "The Red Bull Way." From the foundational principles established by Dietrich Mateschitz's vision to the influential role of Ralph Rangnick in shaping an aggressive and proactive gameplay, we explored the dynamic and unique approach that sets the Red Bulls apart.

The philosophy extends beyond the pitch, integrating business and football management into a cohesive strategy, creating a global network of clubs and players that share a consistent style. The emphasis on creativity, aggression, and an attractive brand of football became evident through strategic build-up, high-intensity pressing, and a relentless pursuit of goal-scoring opportunities.

Our analysis went further by using data from match logs to quantify and define the "Red Bull Style of Play." We introduced a metric that measures how closely a team's style mirrors the energetic and unbalanced characteristics of the Red Bull approach. The evaluation of percentiles highlighted key variables where the Red Bulls consistently excel or face challenges, providing a nuanced understanding of their distinctive playstyle.

Additionally, we explored the relationship between the Red Bull Style of Play metric and win probabilities, showcasing how the team's unique approach correlates with success on the field. Jesse Marsch's 2018 team stood out as a remarkable example of successfully translating their style into winning soccer.

Finally, we conducted a detailed analysis of a historic game -- the 7-0 victory over NYCFC. The "Red Wedding" witnessed an extraordinary performance, with goals reflecting the team's dominance, purposeful play, and relentless pressing.

For next steps, ideally what I would have liked to do for this project was to apply my RBSOP metric to this one particular game to see how it stacks up to the distribution compared to the rest of the games in terms of the "Red Bull Style of Play". Given a sufficient amount of data the metric can be reproduced, better evaluated, potentially altered and improved. I also had the intention of comparing NYRB to an MLS adjusted version of RB Leipzig (I had the data scraped and everything), but due to a lack of time I'll have to save that analysis for another day.

In conclusion, the Red Bull philosophy and style of play represent a holistic approach that transcends traditional boundaries between business and sports. The commitment to an aggressive and attractive brand of football, coupled with data-driven analysis, defines the Red Bull Way and shapes the team's success on the field.

Please let me know if you have any questions or request further insights. I am looking forward to hearing your feedback.
