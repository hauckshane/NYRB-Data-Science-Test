The team commits multiple players to the ball during the press, with an awareness of the need to quickly revert to a defensive shape if the opposition manages to switch play. This comprehensive approach aims to optimize the success of the pressing strategy and create goal-scoring opportunities.</figcaption>

<h3 id="process-of-calculating-percentiles"><strong><em>Process of Calculating Percentiles</em></strong></h3>
<div class="r-fit-text">
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The What:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Percentiles indicate where each club’s average normalized values for each stat stand compared to the overall distribution of teams.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Why:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With the Red Bulls distinct, energetic and some might say unbalanced style of play they tend to be in the tail ends of the distributions of various metrics.</li>
<li>Percentiles were calculated to see what stats the NYRB were accumulating the most over the past 6 seasons compared to the rest of the MLS.</li>
<li>This helps do 2 things:
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate some of these variables further to see how “extreme” the play style is.</p></li>
<li><p>Use these percentiles as weights in a metric defining “Red Bull Style of Play” to value what is “important” to the style.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The How:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, find the mean for each variable for each club in each year.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu_i = \text{mean}(\text{x}_i \mid (\text{club} \cap \text{year}))\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Next, create a normalized value based on said mean for each variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(N_i = (\mu_i - min(\mu) / (max(\mu) - min(\mu))\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Then, for each club take the mean of the normalized values.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(M_i = mean(N_i | club)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Finally, calculate the percentile for the mean of the averaged normalized values.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_i = M_i / max(M)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The What:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A metric that can be applied for each team to each game to quantify a value that represents the “Red Bull Style of Play”.</li>
<li>Values between 0 and 1 where as the value increases towards 1 the teams style of play for the game more closely mirrors the “Red Bull Style of Play”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Why:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The metric is designed to align with the Red Bull distinct style, capturing the essence of their dynamic and appealing approach to the game while showing how different they are to other teams.</li>
<li>Recognizes that certain statistical attributes, when exhibited by the team, contribute more significantly to embodying the distinctive and impactful style.</li>
<li>Enables a nuanced understanding of how closely a team’s style of play mirrors the energetic and unbalanced characteristics of play.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The How:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, create a normalized value for each statistic for each match.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(N_i = (x - min(x) / (max(x) - min(x))\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Then, multiply normalized values by the NYRB percentile for given stat.</p>

<h2><u><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></u></h2>
<p>In this presentation, we delved into the distinctive philosophy and style of play embraced by the New York Red Bulls, commonly known as “The Red Bull Way.” From the foundational principles established by Dietrich Mateschitz’s vision to the influential role of Ralph Rangnick in shaping an aggressive and proactive gameplay, we explored the dynamic and unique approach that sets the Red Bulls apart.</p>
<p>The philosophy extends beyond the pitch, integrating business and football management into a cohesive strategy, creating a global network of clubs and players that share a consistent style. The emphasis on creativity, aggression, and an attractive brand of football became evident through strategic build-up, high-intensity pressing, and a relentless pursuit of goal-scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>Our analysis went further by using data from match logs to quantify and define the “Red Bull Style of Play.” We introduced a metric that measures how closely a team’s style mirrors the energetic and unbalanced characteristics of the Red Bull approach. The evaluation of percentiles highlighted key variables where the Red Bulls consistently excel or face challenges, providing a nuanced understanding of their distinctive playstyle.</p>
<p>Additionally, we explored the relationship between the Red Bull Style of Play metric and win probabilities, showcasing how the team’s unique approach correlates with success on the field. Jesse Marsch’s 2018 team stood out as a remarkable example of successfully translating their style into winning soccer.</p>
<p>Finally, we conducted a detailed analysis of a historic game – the 7-0 victory over NYCFC. The “Red Wedding” witnessed an extraordinary performance, with goals reflecting the team’s dominance, purposeful play, and relentless pressing.</p>
<p>For next steps, ideally what I would have liked to do for this project was to apply my RBSOP metric to this one particular game to see how it stacks up to the distribution compared to the rest of the games in terms of the “Red Bull Style of Play”. Given a sufficient amount of data the metric can be reproduced, better evaluated, potentially altered and improved. I also had the intention of comparing NYRB to an MLS adjusted version of RB Leipzig (I had the data scraped and everything), but due to a lack of time I’ll have to save that analysis for another day.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Red Bull philosophy and style of play represent a holistic approach that transcends traditional boundaries between business and sports. The commitment to an aggressive and attractive brand of football, coupled with data-driven analysis, defines the Red Bull Way and shapes the team’s success on the field.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or request further insights. I am looking forward to hearing your feedback.</p>
